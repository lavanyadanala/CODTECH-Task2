Overview of the Project:
Project: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression on mtcars dataset

Objective:
The objective of the project is to perform linear regression on a dataset containing cars data. The aim is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable.

Key Activities:
A simple linear regression technique attempts to plot a line graph between two data variables, x and y. As the independent variable, x is plotted along the horizontal axis. Independent variables are also called explanatory variables or predictor variables.

Technologies used:
Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value.
